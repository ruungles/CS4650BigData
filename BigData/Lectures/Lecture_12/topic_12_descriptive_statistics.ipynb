    "* A _population_ is a collection of objects about which information is sought;\n",

    "* Data Preparation, where we collect the data and format the data so it is appropriate for analysis.  This usually involves obtaining the data, parsing the data, cleaning the data, and possibly build convenient data structures for storing the data.\n",
