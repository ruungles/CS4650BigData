    "# CS4650 Topic 9: Map Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to run Map-Reduce projects.  One of the interesting ways is using a Jupyter Notebook.  Notebooks provide a really nice way to experiment, try things, then document the results.  In fact, this lecture was written using a Notebook, and there were a lot of iterations as I was experimenting with the code, adjusting the mappers and reducers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for iterations was that, as I looked at the results, I thought of new questions to ask, new calculations to explore.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Usually when you iterate in a Notebook, you go back to a Cell and change things a bit, then rerun.  I didn't do that much, rather I duplicated Cells, so that you could see the progression of my experiments.  Sometimes this meant that I was subtlely changing function names, so there wouldn't be collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MRJob\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very useful package called MRJob.  I refer to it as 'Mister Job', but it really means 'Map-Reduce Job'.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MRJob, you write one function that is the Mapper, another which is the Reducer (and you can also write a Combiner).  You can then run this on a dataset on your computer, right within Notebook.  Or you can connect to the web and run the job on a cluster of computers.  The local machine is usually running sample data, used to debug the code, while the cluster is used for the production run.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install mrjob, activate the environment to be used, then in the Terminal enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge mrjob\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The '-c conda-forge' is telling conda where to search for the mrjob package.  Conda has a site with many packages, and this is the default place to find packages.  However, mrjob is not in that default site.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how to use mrjob in just a bit."

    "## Word Count\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, let's write a program to scan through a large text document, finding all words in that document, then counting how many times each of those words were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to create a new directory and a new environment for this project, since we are going to be downloading extra files, and you don't want to clutter up your workspace by having files from different projects all in the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any event, you will want to create a new Jupyter Notebook.  I've called mine _word-count_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the source of data for our project:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a website, _www.gutenberg.org_, that collects public-domain books, providing these for free.  They've got over 60,000 books.  The books are available in a number of formats, we will use the UTF-8 text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are text documents, so each is just the words.  The old ASCII format is not sufficient, even though all English words can be expressed in ASCII, words from other languages use characters other than A-Z.  Hence, Unicode is used for these books, and UTF-8 is a convenient way to represent Unicode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've chosen 3 books to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Count of Monte Cristo\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will send the text to your browser.  You can then save the page to a file.  Save it to the file _alice.txt_, in your current project folder.\n",

    "# Writing the Mapper and Reducer\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to write some Python code, which will be the mapper and the reducer for our MapReduce job.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this has to be in a separate file, it cannot be in the Notebook itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?  Well, if we are going to run the MapReduce on a cluster of computers, then the code for the Mapper and Reducer has to be farmed out to a bunch of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system could just take the code from one Cell of the Notebook, but maybe the code would extend beyond just one Cell.  And recall that we can define variables and functions in one Cell, but then use these values in other Cells.  So how would the system know which Cells to grab code from for each of the other machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the code has to be in a separate, stand-alone file.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an interesting trick that can be employed: You can have a Cell in the Notebook _create the Python file_.  In this way, the Notebook is self-contained.  If the Notebook is shared, the Notebook itself will create that Python file, then use it for the MapReduce job.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a special feature of Notebook which allows a Cell to create a file from the contents of the Cell.  Notebook has several features like this, these are called _magic_ commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will start the Cell (a Code Cell) with the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%file word_count.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This magic line indicates that the contents of the cell (following this magic line) are to be written to the named file.  Later we will see mrjob use this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we re-run this Cell, that file will get re-written.  That's OK!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a second trick, which is commonly used, appearing at the end of this Cell.  Here is that code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    WordFrequency.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That 'WordFrequence' is the class that we will be defining in this Cell.  The above code checks to see if this is being executed as a Cell being run, and if so, it runs an instance of our mrjob subclass.  But later we will discuss what happens if we are executing this on a cluster.  For now, though, we will simply add this to the bottom of the Cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Cell is the complete implementation of the first version of our mapper/reducer!"

Each of these tokens are a String, and the String class knows how to generate a lowercase version of itself.  Thus, we will simply convert all strings to lowercase, then 'box' and 'Box' (and 'bOX') would all be considered the same word.  This will also convert 'Fred' to 'fred', but we can live with that.\n",

    "## Compound Words, Unicode\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are adopting the plan of removing non-alphabetic characters, we have removed hyphens, so compound words are now just run together, and we have removed unicode characters, which may have removed important letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these were important issues, we could write other 'rules' to handle these characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to replace hyphens with spaces, so the compound words would simply become different words, we could replace '-' with ' ', before we do the split of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the unicode example, we could search for critical unicode characters, then replace them with the roughly equivalent ASCII character.  This can be done after the split, but should be done before we remove the punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introductory Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the text files we downloaded, you will see that the first several lines of the file are not actually part of the book, but rather provide an introduction to the book.  This lists the author, date of publication, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This material ends at a line starting with \"*** START \".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can filter this portion of the file by declaring an instance variable for the class, initializing the value to false.  Then, as the mapper scans a line, it checks to see if the line starts with \"*** START\".  If so, it will set that flag to be true.  If the flag was false, we then do not yield any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a problem with this, however.  When we distribute the job across a cluster of computers, each processor will have a subset of the data, a portion of the file.  It is only the processor that is processing the very first part of the data that should do this check.  All of the other processors _should not_ do this check, because then they will never see the \"*** START\", so they will never 'turn on'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, for our purposes, we will ignore this, and so the introductory matter will also be added to the word counts."

    "## The Mapper\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, for each word the mapper found, it output the word, along with a count of 1, because it had just seen one instance of that word.  The word was the key, and the count was the value.  Because the word was the key, the shuffle, combine, and reduce gathered all of the data for each word (the key), then output a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our new problem, the key will actually be the _length_ of the word, because we want to aggregate and count things based on this length.  But we then need to output _two_ values, the word and the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the yield, we want to send three things: length, word, and count.  But MapReduce is set to only have two things, a key and a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we will use the length as the key, but for the value we will make an object that contains two values.  The object will have an example word and it will have a count.  Since we will be communicating these values through streams, as text, we need an object that can be serialized as JSON.  If we use a Python dictionary, the object will be automatically serialized as JSON, and at the other end, automatically reconstructed as a dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the new problem, the reducer receives a key, which is the length of the word, and a list of dictionaries.  The reducer will take one of the example words (probably either the first or the last), and it will sum up the counts.  It will then return a key, which is the same length as was in the input, and a value, which is a dictionary holding an example word and the total count for that word.\n",
